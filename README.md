# Filtr
A java based GUI application that allows the user to apply filter(s) to an image.

The application starts with a prompt to add an image, edit an image that had a filter apllied to it, and some more things. I don't know, you'll add. 

# Add image
Once an image has been uploaded, the user must be able to select a premade filter (there must be at least 50 cuz why not) or to be able to change the image properties themselves. 
Whoever wants to add more to general idea, is welcome to do so.
